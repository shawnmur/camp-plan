# Camp Plan Privacy Policy
Effective Date: August 10, 2025

Shawn Murphy, author of Camp Plan ("I", “we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use Camp Plan.

### 1. Data Collection
Camp Plan stores all of it's information locally on your device. This ensures that the app works in the backcountry without service while also minimizing the amount of data collected.

Some featuers of the application use location information, specifically:
- Weather forecasts are downloaded for the location of each day's camp or the last location provided in a day's trip plan. If you request a weather forecast, those locations will be sent to a 3rd party service (as noted below) soley for the purpose of obtaining a weather forecast.
- The On Trail tab allows you to use your current device location so you can view the time remaining for today's activity and use your current elevation to estimate the actual weather for your location
- The On Trail tab allows you to optionally record a track of your location during the trip. This track is saved to the trip file and you can export it from the Recap tab. This track is kept local to the device. If you share a trip file the shared trip file will include the track.

Some features of the app do rely on Third Party Services.

You may choose to share a trip with somebody via the sharing feature. Any participant names or saved tracks in the trip will be included in the file you send. You are responsible for any information you chose to share. 

### 2. Third-Party Services
Camp Plan uses data from the following Third-Party Services to obtain data at your request. These requests do not include any personal information, and CampPlan does not add any personal information, user identifiers or device identifers when calling these services. Like all network requests, these services will recieve your IP Address. I've tried to find services that are privacy aware and require minimal information for their APIs.

*Weather Forecasts*

If you request a weather forecast, Camp Plan will send the forecast coordinates you configured in the app to a weather provider for the purposes of getting a forecast. You can control whether or not this information is sent by not requesting a weather forecast 

- US National Weather Service Weather APIs for weather forecasts within the United States - https://api.weather.gov/
- Open-Meteo APIs for weather forecasts in the rest of the world - https://open-meteo.com/


*Food Nutrition Information*

If you scan or enter a barcood when adding food to the app, Camp Plan will send the barcode to OpenFoodFacts.org to obtain information about the food item. Open Food Facts is a collaborative, free and open database of food products from around the world. Information this site is provided by community members. Details about Open Food Fact's terms of use and privacy policies are available at https://world.openfoodfacts.org/.


*Maps*

Camp Plan includes a simple map feature powered by Open Street Map. for setting the location of camps, start and end location for activities, and to override your current location if you choose not to turn on your device GPS. The app also uses Open-Meteo to obtain the elevation for the coordinates you tap when selecting a point on the map.

If you want to set or change a location on a camp or activity, Camp Plan will send the coordinates to Open Street Map for the purpose of showing you the map at that location. Camp Plan does not send your device's current location when opening the map.

*Anonymous Diagnostic Information*

Camp Plan uses Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous information about crashes and problems with the app. I use these crash reports to fix problems and improve the stability of the app. You can turn off anonymous diagnostic reports in Settings.

According to Google, Firebase Crashlytics collects and sends the following information if there is major problem with the app:
- Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
- Firebase installations ID
- Crash traces
- Breakpad minidump formatted data (NDK crashes only)

How it helps: Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to Examples of stored device information for more detail on the types of user information gathered.

Retention: Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces, extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.

Details about information that Firebase Crashlytics collects is available at https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy#crash-stored-info 


### 3. Children’s Privacy
The app allows you to state that a participant is a child. This setting is only used to estimate calories and assist with your trip planning.

Since the app keeps all data on your device, it should be compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations worldwide. Please use caution if you are sharing a trip file where you've added children if you are concerned about maintaining their privacy.

### 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app or here. Please review this policy periodically for updates.
