# Camp Plan Privacy Policy
Effective Date: June 7, 2025

Shawn Murphy, author of Camp Plan ("I", “we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use Camp Plan.

### 1. Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or share any personal data or user information through our app. Some of our Third-Party Services require information, you have full control over whether you use those services as noted below.

This includes, but is not limited to: email address, phone number, device location data

If you provide a name for a participant in the trip, Camp Plan does not send this information to any Third-Party services. The name is only used to help you plan your trip on the device.

You may choose to share a trip with somebody via the sharing feature. Any participant names in the trip will be included in the file you send. You are responsible for any information you chose to share. 

### 2. Third-Party Services
Camp Plan uses data from the following Third-Party Services to obtain data at your request. These requests do not include any personal information, and CampPlan does not add any personal information, user identifiers or device identifers when calling these services. Like all network requests, these services will recieve your IP Address.

*Weather Forecasts*

If you request a weather forecast, Camp Plan will send the forecast coordinates you configured in the app to a weather provider for the purposes of getting a forecast. You can control whether or not this information is sent by not requesting a weather forecast 

- US National Weather Service Weather APIs for weather forecasts within the United States - https://api.weather.gov/
- Open-Meteo APIs for weather forecasts in the rest of the world - https://open-meteo.com/


*Food Nutrition Information*

If you scan or enter a barcood when adding food to the app, Camp Plan will send the barcode to OpenFoodFacts.org to obtain information about the food item. Open Food Facts is a collaborative, free and open database of food products from around the world. Information this site is provided by community members. Details about Open Food Fact's terms of use and privacy policies are available at https://world.openfoodfacts.org/.


*Maps*

Camp Plan includes a simple map feature powered by Open Street Map. for setting the location of camps and the start and end location for activities. These locations are used to obtain weather forecasts, if you choose to download a weather forecast. 

If you want to set or change a locatio non a camp or activity, Camp Plan will send the coordinates to Open Street Map for the purpose of showing you the map at that location. Camp Plan does NOT have a feature for collecting your device's current location.


*Anonymous Diagnostic Information*

Camp Plan uses Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous information about crashes and problems with the app. I use these crash reports to fix problems and improve the stability of the app. You can turn off anonymous diagnostic reports in Settings.

According to Google, Firebase Crashlytics collects and sends the following information if there is major problem with the app:
- Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
- Firebase installations ID
- Crash traces
- Breakpad minidump formatted data (NDK crashes only)

How it helps: Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to Examples of stored device information for more detail on the types of user information gathered.

Retention: Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces, extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.

Details about information that Firebase Crashlytics collects is available at https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy#crash-stored-info 


### 3. Children’s Privacy
The app allows you to state that a participant is a child. This setting is only used to estimate calories.

Since we do not collect any personal information, our app is compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations worldwide.

### 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app or here. Please review this policy periodically for updates.
